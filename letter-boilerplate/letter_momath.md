Dear Hiring Manager,

I was excited to hear about the creative technology internship at the National Museum of Mathematics. My name is Mark Lam and I am a graduating Masters student at New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program (NYU ITP). I have a diverse development background, with a specialization in Digital Accessibility. 

At ITP I worked with a wide range of technologies to communicate abstract and complex ideas. I made projects using network data including TCP/IP and wireless signals to create data driven projects that demystify computer networking. For my thesis project I created educational animations, a website, and a series of experimental network routers to share the router's role in network topology. 

In other projects, I used Arduinos and Raspberry Pis to send sensory data to a databases to visualize and manipulate spatial environments through lighting. I've also used mobile phone and browser technology to mediate sounds based on parameters such as device orientation and location. My technological skill sets include: full stack web development, DIY electronics, and fabrication.

In addition to development, I bring a wide range of design skills. I previously designed exhibition graphics and marketing animations for SFO Museum. At SFO museum I learned a lot about the different teams in a museum environment and learned how to collaborate with the various teams - from the preparator staff to curatorial staff.

I am excited in museums and their ability to delight and educate diverse audiences. In light of the pandemic, I believe that there is a lot of potential to engage in new ways with museum-goers. I would be eager to speak with you more about how I might be able to contribute to MoMath as a creative technology intern to create engaging and accessible experiences.

Sincerely,
