Dear Caroline,
I am excited to learn about the software engineering internship with the security team at Button, Inc. as I am drawn to understanding the infrastructure of the networks around us and creating safer systems. I am completing my Master's degree at New York University in the Interactive Telecommunications Program where I emphasize in computer networking technology and building alternative networks while taking supplemental courses in cyber security at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

My studies explored the whole network stack, from developing user facing applications to designing conceptual networks. My master's thesis explored the position of consumer routers on a network and potential interventions to shape how peers engage within a network. In addition to conceptual projects, I design teaching material and workshops on topics ranging from automation scripting to practical digital security practices.

I would love to learn more about the networking industry from an innovative mobile company and familiarize myself with specific areas in network engineering around security.
 
My diverse background working in design, web development and operations provides me a unique experience that I can contribute to Button in innovative ways. I  would love the opportunity to learn from the team at Button and would be eager to schedule a time for us to discuss further about the Software Engineering internship with the Security Team. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,
