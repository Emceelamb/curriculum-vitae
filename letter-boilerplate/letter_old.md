Hello!

I'm happy that ITP Camp is happening this year! My name is Mark Lam and I am a graduating ITP student. ITP Camp is a special place for me, where I was first exposed to ITP when I attended camp in 2016 before applying. Last summer I worked in the ITP Shop while Camp was happening and I helped campers with equipment and projects as well as leading a workshop around network security.

I bring a wide range of skills, where I studied graphic and multimedia design in undergrad. I am well versed in Adobe CC products as well as motion graphic/ animation techniques, computer and frame by frame animation. Primarily, my focus at ITP has been centered around computer networking where many projects involved developing IoT devices and various computer networking topics, including: automation, data scraping, deployment, and network analysis. 

Additionally, I have a strong interest in digital accessibility where I co-lead workshops introducing digital accessibility practices and tools to ITP accessibility student workers. I also mentored a first year student in developing an accessible front-end to the project database. This past semester I was also a mentor at ITP's new Coding Lab. I provided one-on-one office hours to help ITP/IMA/ and out of department students support with their coding projects. This continued through the pandemic and I got valuable experience teaching coding in an online environment.

I think that the online environment for ITP Camp offers unique opportunities to engage with campers. For example, when ITP moved to Discord I developed a Coding Lab Discord bot which allowed students to streamline getting information about the Coding Lab hours and mentors. There were also other novel ways to engage online with ITP when some peers made a Minecraft server and the revival of the wacky Yorb project. It will be exciting to see what Campers will do with this new medium. Also, I hope that at some point during the camp that gather restrictions may be loosened and I would be happy to facilitate small group meetings if possible.

I'm looking forward to seeing ITP camp this year and would be eager to be involved as a camp counselor.

Sincerely,
