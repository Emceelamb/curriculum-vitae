Dear Hiring Manager,

Lately, I have been thinking about how modern technologies can effect tangible change. IBM has a long history producing technological innovations that have shaped the digital era. It is a dream of mine to work in a mission critical environment to deploy progressive innovations. I believe that I am an excellent candidate for IBM's DevOps Engineering internship with a passion for both making an impact the deployment pipeline.

For the past two years I have been fully immersed in emerging technology while studying at New York University Interactive Telecommunications Program. I emphasized in computer networking while supplementing with classes in network security at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering. I developed a series of conceptual networking related projects - from deep packet inspection to visualizing the layers of the OSI model. I developed teaching materials and workshops on topics ranging from automation scripting to practical digital security practices.

My diverse background working in design, web development and operations provides me a unique experience with collaborating between teams and creating work processes. I would love to schedule a time for us to discuss the DevOps Engineer internship  and how my experience can contribute to IBM and I would like to thank you for considering me. 

Sincerely,
