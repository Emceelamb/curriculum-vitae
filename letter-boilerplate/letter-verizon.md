Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to learn about the network engineering internship opportunity at Verizon as I am drawn to understanding the infrastructure of the networks around us. I am completing my Master's degree at New York University in the Interactive Telecommunications Program where I emphasize in computer networking technology and building alternative networks while taking supplemental courses in cyber security at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

My studies explored the whole network stack, from developing user facing applications to designing alternative networks. My master's thesis explored the position of consumer routers on a network and potential interventions to shape how peers engage with a network. In addition to conceptual projects, I design teaching material and workshops on topics ranging from automation scripting to practical digital security practices.

I would love to learn more about the telecommunications industry from one of the nation's largest network providers and familiarize myself with specific areas in network engineering from security to DevOps practices.
 
My diverse background working in design, web development and operations provides me a unique experience that I can contribute to Verizon in innovative ways. I  would love the opportunity to learn from the team at Verizon and would be eager to schedule a time for us to discuss further about the Network Engineering internship. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,
