Dear Hiring Manager

I read with interest about the Web Accessibility and Engineering opportunities with Uptime2020. I recently completed my Master's degree at New York University in the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), where I focused on creating accessible interactive technology, while working with one of the nation's largest performing arts institutions.

My research explores a range of emerging technology, building on over 3 years of experience as a developer. Previously, I was a Digital Accessibility Fellow at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, where I audited their digital platforms to meet established accessibility standards. In addition my in-depth knowledge of accessibility, I am experienced in software development. While project lead at NYU's ITP Web Access team, I improved their web infrastructure by developing a front-end interface to a project database that is fully compliant to WCAG standards. I coordinated development with project managers, and designers using github and other collaborative design software.

I am passionate about making accessible technology and projects for social impact. I have led workshops in conferences to talk about importance of digital security and practical measures to take. Recently, I am working with a group of volunteers to develop an archive of NYC Department of Transportation footage to address concerns surrounding police misconduct in support of the Black Lives Matters Movement.

I believe that I am a good fit to work with Uptime2020 to create accessible tools, especially around civic technology and social good. I would love the opportunity to schedule a time for us to discuss further about how I can work with Uptime2020. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,
