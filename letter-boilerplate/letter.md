Dear Hiring Manager

I read with interest about the Junior Web Developer position with Other Means. I recently completed my Master's degree at New York University in the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), where I focused on developing accessible interactive technology, building upon prior experience as a web developer.

In a past life, I studied graphic and multi-media design, working as a graphic designer for museums and e-commerce websites. I later picked up web development as a means to see a project through from design to implementation and have since primarily worked as a developer, while retaining my acumen for quality design and keeping up with design trends.

My current work explores a range of emerging technology, building on experience as a web developer. I was a Digital Accessibility Fellow at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, where I audited their digital platforms to meet established accessibility standards. While at NYU, I was a project lead for NYU's ITP Web Access team. I improved their web infrastructure by developing a front-end interface to a project database. I coordinated development with project managers, and designers using github and other collaborative design software such as Figma.

I am passionate about rich interactive experiences and bringing to life evocative design. I have extensive experience working as a free lance developer with clients that use a range of technology as well as collaborating with designers and project managers. With my diverse background in both design and development, I would be eager to speak further how I can collaborate with Other Means studio.


Sincerely,
