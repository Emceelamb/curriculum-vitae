Dear Hiring Manager,

Lately, I have been thinking about how modern technologies can effect tangible change. I feel that the vision of Adobe systems is aligned with my interests by producing tools and services for designers and artists. Having come from a design background I extensively used Adobe tools and as I moved towards technical roles it has been a dream of mine to work with Adobe Systems and in the role of a Site Reliability I would be able to have an impact throughout the deployment pipeline.

For the past two years I have been fully immersed in emerging technology while studying at New York University Interactive Telecommunications Program. I studied computer networking and network security NYU's Tandon School of Engineering and developed a passion for networking related projects from packet analysis to visualizing the layers in the OSI model. From this research I developed teaching materials and workshops on topics ranging from automation with Bash Scripting to practical digital security practices.

My diverse background working in design and warehouse operations provides me a unique experience with collaborating between teams, building automation tools and processes to foster cooperation between business and operations.

I would love to schedule a time for us to discuss this role and how my experience can contribute to Adobe Systems and I would like to thank you for considering me. 

Sincerely,
