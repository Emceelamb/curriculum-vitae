Dear Codecademy,

I read with interest about the Content Contributor position with Codecademy. I recently completed my Master's degree at New York University in the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), where I focused on developing accessible interactive technology, building upon prior experience as a web developer and often used p5.js to prototype and test ideas.

I'm particularly drawn to Codecademy, because as a self taught programmer, resources like Codecademy were extremely helpful in progressing my development career. My current work explores a range of emerging technology, building on experience as a web developer. I was a Digital Accessibility Fellow at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, where I audited their digital platforms to meet established accessibility standards. While at NYU, I was a project lead for NYU's ITP Web Access team. I improved their web infrastructure by developing a front-end interface to a project database. 

I am passionate about coding and helping others to learn. I have extensive experience working as an instructor, where I tutored student in coding at NYU IT. Before starting my graduate program, I taught web development workshops in Vietnam to non-computer science majors. Through this, I learned how to introduce technical topics in a digestible way. With my diverse background in education and development, I would be eager to speak further how I can collaborate with Codecademy. Thank you for you time and consideration.


Sincerely,
